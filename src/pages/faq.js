        <p>Are all of these Indian designs authentic? Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs. </p>
        <p>When was the Overlook built? - Ah... construction started in 1907. It was finished in 1909. The site is supposed to be located on an Indian burial ground, and I believe they actually had to repel a few Indian attacks as they were building it. </p>
