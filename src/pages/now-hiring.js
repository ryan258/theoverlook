      <h2>Caretaker position open</h2>
      <Container>
        <p>the basic idea is to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation that can occur</p>
        <p>this consists mainly of:</p>
        <p>running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis</p>
        <p>repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold</p>
        <p>physically it's not a very demanding job. The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation</p>
        <p>for some people eh solitude and isolation can of itself be a problem</p>
        <p>Caretaker's Apartment. </p>
        <p>This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter. </p>
        <p>Living Room, bedroom, bathroom, and a small bedroom for your son. </p>
        <p>plus there is a kitchen with a fridge</p>
        <p>Well the place is very nicely self- contained, easy to keep. </p>
        <p>Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in. </p>
        <p>That's our Snowcat. Can you both drive a car?</p>
        <p>We always remove all the booze from the premises when we shut down: </p>
        <p>Well one thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice. </p>
        <p>You got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers. You got twelve- turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb. </p>
        <p>In here, Mrs. Torrance, is where we keep all the dried goods and the canned goods. We got canned fruits and vegetables; canned fish and meats; hot and cold cereals. HALLORAN & WENDY move L-R - CAMERA TRACKS with them past shelf in f.g. HALLORAN Post Toasties, Cornflakes, Sugar Puffs, Rice Krispies, Oatmeal, Wheatina and Cream of Wheat. CUT TO: M.S. DANNY standing by cardboard boxes. CAMERA TRACKS IN on him. HALLORAN (OFF) We got a dozen jugs of black molasses, we got sixty boxes of dried milk, thirty twelve pound bags of sugar. </p>
        <p>sociables, finger rolls and seven kinds of what-have-you. CUT TO: M.S. HALLORAN & WENDY move R-L to DANNY by open door. CAMERA TRACKS with them. HALLORAN Now we got dried peaches, dried apricots, dried raisins and dried prunes. </p>
        <h2>tragedy during the winter of 1970</h2>

        <p> Well, my predecessor in this job hired a man named Charles Grady, as the winter caretaker. He came up here with his wife and two little girls of about eight or ten. And he had a good employment record, good references and from what I've been told, I mean, he seemed like a completely normal individual. But at some point during the winter, he must have suffered some kind of a complete mental breakdown. He ran amok and eh... killed his family with an axe, stacked them neatly in one of the rooms in the West Wing, and then he um... then he put eh both barrels of his shotgun in his mouth. </p>
        <p>The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are shut in together over long periods of time. </p>
